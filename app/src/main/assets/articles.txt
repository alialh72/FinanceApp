Guide to Form T2200*Andrew Goldman*If you are an employee and hope to deduct work expenses, you'll absolutely need to know what a Form T2200 is.*Form T2200 is provided by your employer and allows you to claim expenses you incur to do your job, such as your home office and car. But driving your car to the office every day and occasionally tapping out some work emails at your dining room table won’t get you a T2200, or, for that matter, a justification for a tax deduction on your car payment or rent. T2200s are sent to a very specific subset of workers who wouldn’t be able to do their jobs otherwise unless they take on the financial burden of specific unreimbursed expenses.*Unless you are an employer, you won’t need to fill out the T2200 yourself; it’s something that most employers will complete automatically and deliver to you. Unlike, say, T4s, T2200s will only be provided to you, the employee. The CRA will receive no copy of it. This doesn’t mean it’s not important. It’s one of those things that you’ll really need if and when the CRA comes knocking for any supporting documentation based on your submitted tax return, so if you get a T2200, keep it in a safe easily-accessed place far out of reach of paper-eating pets. Possession of form T2200 opens the door for you to fill out form T777, which is where you’ll itemize your various deductible expenses. Unlike the T2200, the CRA actually requires you to send them a completed copy of this form.*Besides an employee’s name, address and social insurance number, the T2200 features just 13 questions. The most basic but important one indicates whether the employee is allowed to claim anything. “Did this employees contract require them to pay their own expenses while carrying out the duties of employment?” An answer of “no” to this question means the employee won’t be able to deduct any expenses at all. Other questions ask whether the employee must travel to places other than the office as part of her job. Does the employee need to rent an office? Have a car? A business cell phone? Use part of their home as an office? Need to own a power saw?*Taxes*https://assets.ey.com/content/dam/ey-sites/ey-com/en_ca/webcast/ey-work-from-home-webcast-banner.jpg*P0CrqETEuDk

How the Stock Market Works*Ali A*Are you confused on how the stock market works? Well this article will go over all that you need to know to get started.*What’s the one thing a stock market needs to operate? Why stocks, of course! So before we tackle the real edge-of-your-seat topic of how the stock market operates, let’s start by defining our terms.*What the heck is a stock? A stock represents a share in a company’s ownership, and those who own stocks can claim a percentage of the company’s assets and earnings. Exactly what percentage depends on how many shares you own relative to how many currently exist — or in finance speak, the “outstanding.” With some simple division, we learn that a stockholder who owns 100 shares of a company with 5 million outstanding shares owns .00002 of the company.*When the company first issues shares, they often do so through what’s called an initial public offering, or IPO. Since it’s the first time they’re sold, this is called a stock’s “primary market.” Once the shares have been sold that first time, stockholders will need a place to resell them, kind of like a used car lot for stocks. This is called the stocks’ “secondary market,” but it’s more familiarly referred to as just “the stock market.”*Investing*https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5f2b139cc5d1415541643908/960x0.jpg?fit=scale*p7HKvqRI_Bo
What is Cryptocurrency?*Robert Stevens*Cryptocurrencies may seem like some magical invisible currency. Hopefully this article will make it clear what a cryptocurrency is.*Let’s start simple: Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that, like all cryptocurrencies, runs on a technology called blockchain, a publicly available, decentralized ledger. Basically, this is a big database that records transactions. It’s maintained by everyone who uses the network, can’t be tampered with, and all transactions are recorded on it are public, for anyone to see.*Most people know about Bitcoin, but it’s just one of many coins on the market. On CoinMarketCap, which lists the coins currently trading, there are 2,400 coins. In part, that’s because it’s relatively easy to create a coin, and there aren’t many regulations. But take that figure with a pinch of salt: Only 900 coins currently trade more than $1 million a day.*You can trade cryptocurrencies on the market. Most trading is done on exchanges—safe bets are industry giants Binance or Coinbase. Signing up for an account is about as easy as joining PayPal. Most accept transfers of cryptocurrencies, but you’ll have to use a credit card or wire transfer if you want to buy with fiat currencies. After this, your website of choice might ask you to verify your identity—usually asking for a passport or driving licence, and then you’re turned loose onto the cryptocurrency exchange, to sink or swim at your own risk. Don’t let pundits confuse you: Pay attention to wider market trends and put your money in the larger, established networks if you want to stay safe.*Crypto*https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2020/04/10/901440-cryptocurrency.jpg*kubGCSj5y3k
Active vs Passive Investing*Andrew Goldman*Not quite sure what the difference between these 2 strategies are? This article will go over that.*If you know anything at all about mutual funds, you probably already have a decent sense of what active investing is. The vast majority of mutual funds are actively managed, meaning they employ a fund manager, who’s a little like the captain of a ship or the CEO of a corporation. Before beginning a fund, the fund manager will set out his qualifications and general parameters for choosing securities in a prospectus, then, for as long as he’s the fund manager, will have a free hand to buy and sell securities for that fund in hopes of outperforming its benchmark, or the average return of similar investments. The mutual fund will grow and shrink according to how much is invested but its holdings will remain proportional to whatever the fund manager has set out. This buying and selling action is what makes this kind of investment active. You might say active investing involves a lot of futzing.*Active investing involves paying a human to buy and sell individual stocks regularly through mutual funds. A passive investing strategy involves investing in index ETFs rather than picking stocks. Active investing aims to beat the market where as passive investing aims to track the market.*Let's get one thing straight. Investing passively or actively in index mutual funds and/or ETFs is a far superior strategy to picking individual stocks because you're engaging in something called — diversification. Everybody has a friend whose uncle who knows a guy who invested $700 dollars in Amazon in 1997 and now owns his own continent. Less heralded but more prevalent are the tales of other guys who went all in on Groupon and had to move back into their parents’ garage! Picking stocks is only a marginally better idea than investing in lottery tickets. Many smart investors understand that one way to help protect against precipitous losses in specific stocks, specific economic sectors, and even specific country’s economies is through diversification. When you diversify your investments, if one goes sour it doesn't drag down your entire portfolio. The advantage of active investing is that sometimes, you might do really, really well. Had you owned the small cap Perkins Discovery Fund (PDFDX) in 2017, you would have enjoyed a 39.51% percent return on your investment. If you’d been invested passively in Vanguard’s 500 Index Fund (VFINX) during the same period, you’d only have experienced returns of 18.5%, less than half of the actively traded fund.*Investing*https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-investing-e1595962588896.jpg*9sBeZ47pvzU
Ethereum vs Bitcoin*Robert Stevens*Ethereum and Bitcoin are the two largest cryptocurrencies in the world by market capitalization. Which is better?*Cryptocurrencies are digital cash that runs on a ledger distributed across thousands of computers scattered across the world. Cryptocurrencies are revolutionary because they are entirely digital, and the production of new coins is not controlled by any central authority. Compare that to a central bank, which controls the supply of a country’s currency.*New Bitcoins are minted by a process called “bitcoin mining". Bitcoin mining is based upon a concept called "proof of work,“ which involves computers solving difficult cryptographic puzzles that verify transactions made using Bitcoin. These verified transactions are subsequently added to the Bitcoin blockchain as a part of a “block” (a blockchain is just a chain of these blocks). Ether, like Bitcoin, is also produced by mining, although the blocks are added every 15 seconds rather than every ten minutes. And, like Bitcoin, it runs on a proof of work system. But the issue with proof of work is that it’s very expensive to pay for all of the mining computers, and it requires a great deal of energy. In addition, the mining process itself has become centralized, with mining “pools”—companies who control thousands of miners—controlling the bulk of the network.*Choosing Ethereum over Bitcoin is a little like choosing an apple over an orange: It depends on your taste. If you’re into crypto solely to trade it, there’s little practical difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum, and it’s up to you to speculate on the price. Who knows what’ll happen: Ethereum is moving to a proof of stake chain, and that could affect the price. But, simultaneously, the mining difficulty of Bitcoin is due to halve in 2020 (the result of a rule hardcoded onto the Bitcoin protocol), and pundits say that’s supposed to pump up the price, too. Nobody can predict the future, or, more to the point, the future worth of these two technologies.*Crypto*https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fcom.ft.imagepublish.upp-prod-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1e8db4c2-99c1-11e9-9573-ee5cbb98ed36?fit=scale-down&source=next&width=700*bDiVMhLN2e0
How to make a Budget*Luisa Rollenhagen*This article will teach you all that you need to know to make a budget*To make a budget figure out how much you make per month and how much you spend on necessities and variable expenses. Then apportion and adjust your expenses to ensure you're living within your means and saving enough. You should aim to save or invest at least 20% of your income.*Understanding your financial habits is key to knowing why you have a certain amount coming out each month, and will help you eventually reduce that amount so you’re left with more in your bank account at the end of the month. Sound good/super scary and like lots of work? Awesome, first, 1. figure out how much you make per month, 2. figure out how much you’re spending on necessities per month, 3. figure out your variable expenses, 4. add up all of fixed and variable expenses, and compare to income: If your expenses are higher than your income (or you’re barely breaking even), it’s time to budget!*The best and most obvious place to start will be with your variable expenses. Some tips on reducing your “fun” costs: Cook at home instead of eating out, buy your groceries at a cheaper supermarket, shop the sales. Also consider the 50/30/20 rule. Think of this as more of a guideline than a rule. About 50% of your income should be spent on non-negotiable necessities like rent, utilities, car payments, mortgages, and so forth. Basically, most of your fixed expenses. 30% of your income goes to your variable expenses, where you have the most flexibility for saving and cutting costs. The remaining 20% should be for ensuring your financial health: that means paying off high-interest debt, adding to your savings, and investing for the future. The percentages will vary depending on your income, extra financial needs, and debt situation, but it’s a good benchmark.*Finance*https://www.workflowmax.com/hubfs/budget%20900x400v2.png*VfhmzqDHM4w
