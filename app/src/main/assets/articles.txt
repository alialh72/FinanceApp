How the Stock Market Works*Ali A*Are you confused on how the stock market works? Well this article will go over all that you need to know to get started.*What’s the one thing a stock market needs to operate? Why stocks, of course! So before we tackle the real edge-of-your-seat topic of how the stock market operates, let’s start by defining our terms.*What the heck is a stock? A stock represents a share in a company’s ownership, and those who own stocks can claim a percentage of the company’s assets and earnings. Exactly what percentage depends on how many shares you own relative to how many currently exist — or in finance speak, the “outstanding.” With some simple division, we learn that a stockholder who owns 100 shares of a company with 5 million outstanding shares owns .00002 of the company.*When the company first issues shares, they often do so through what’s called an initial public offering, or IPO. Since it’s the first time they’re sold, this is called a stock’s “primary market.” Once the shares have been sold that first time, stockholders will need a place to resell them, kind of like a used car lot for stocks. This is called the stocks’ “secondary market,” but it’s more familiarly referred to as just “the stock market.”*Investing*https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5f2b139cc5d1415541643908/960x0.jpg?fit=scale
What is Cryptocurrency?*Robert Stevens*Cryptocurrencies may seem like some magical invisible currency. Hopefully this article will make it clear what a cryptocurrency is.*Let’s start simple: Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that, like all cryptocurrencies, runs on a technology called blockchain, a publicly available, decentralized ledger. Basically, this is a big database that records transactions. It’s maintained by everyone who uses the network, can’t be tampered with, and all transactions are recorded on it are public, for anyone to see.*Most people know about Bitcoin, but it’s just one of many coins on the market. On CoinMarketCap, which lists the coins currently trading, there are 2,400 coins. In part, that’s because it’s relatively easy to create a coin, and there aren’t many regulations. But take that figure with a pinch of salt: Only 900 coins currently trade more than $1 million a day.*You can trade cryptocurrencies on the market. Most trading is done on exchanges—safe bets are industry giants Binance or Coinbase. Signing up for an account is about as easy as joining PayPal. Most accept transfers of cryptocurrencies, but you’ll have to use a credit card or wire transfer if you want to buy with fiat currencies. After this, your website of choice might ask you to verify your identity—usually asking for a passport or driving licence, and then you’re turned loose onto the cryptocurrency exchange, to sink or swim at your own risk. Don’t let pundits confuse you: Pay attention to wider market trends and put your money in the larger, established networks if you want to stay safe.*Crypto*https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2020/04/10/901440-cryptocurrency.jpg
