Guide to Form T2200*Andrew Goldman*If you are an employee and hope to deduct work expenses, you'll absolutely need to know what a Form T2200 is.*Form T2200 is provided by your employer and allows you to claim expenses you incur to do your job, such as your home office and car. But driving your car to the office every day and occasionally tapping out some work emails at your dining room table won’t get you a T2200, or, for that matter, a justification for a tax deduction on your car payment or rent. T2200s are sent to a very specific subset of workers who wouldn’t be able to do their jobs otherwise unless they take on the financial burden of specific unreimbursed expenses.*Unless you are an employer, you won’t need to fill out the T2200 yourself; it’s something that most employers will complete automatically and deliver to you. Unlike, say, T4s, T2200s will only be provided to you, the employee. The CRA will receive no copy of it. This doesn’t mean it’s not important. It’s one of those things that you’ll really need if and when the CRA comes knocking for any supporting documentation based on your submitted tax return, so if you get a T2200, keep it in a safe easily-accessed place far out of reach of paper-eating pets. Possession of form T2200 opens the door for you to fill out form T777, which is where you’ll itemize your various deductible expenses. Unlike the T2200, the CRA actually requires you to send them a completed copy of this form.*Besides an employee’s name, address and social insurance number, the T2200 features just 13 questions. The most basic but important one indicates whether the employee is allowed to claim anything. “Did this employees contract require them to pay their own expenses while carrying out the duties of employment?” An answer of “no” to this question means the employee won’t be able to deduct any expenses at all. Other questions ask whether the employee must travel to places other than the office as part of her job. Does the employee need to rent an office? Have a car? A business cell phone? Use part of their home as an office? Need to own a power saw?*Taxes*https://assets.ey.com/content/dam/ey-sites/ey-com/en_ca/webcast/ey-work-from-home-webcast-banner.jpg*P0CrqETEuDk

How the Stock Market Works*Ali A*Are you confused on how the stock market works? Well this article will go over all that you need to know to get started.*What’s the one thing a stock market needs to operate? Why stocks, of course! So before we tackle the real edge-of-your-seat topic of how the stock market operates, let’s start by defining our terms.*What the heck is a stock? A stock represents a share in a company’s ownership, and those who own stocks can claim a percentage of the company’s assets and earnings. Exactly what percentage depends on how many shares you own relative to how many currently exist — or in finance speak, the “outstanding.” With some simple division, we learn that a stockholder who owns 100 shares of a company with 5 million outstanding shares owns .00002 of the company.*When the company first issues shares, they often do so through what’s called an initial public offering, or IPO. Since it’s the first time they’re sold, this is called a stock’s “primary market.” Once the shares have been sold that first time, stockholders will need a place to resell them, kind of like a used car lot for stocks. This is called the stocks’ “secondary market,” but it’s more familiarly referred to as just “the stock market.”*Investing*https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5f2b139cc5d1415541643908/960x0.jpg?fit=scale*p7HKvqRI_Bo
What is Cryptocurrency?*Robert Stevens*Cryptocurrencies may seem like some magical invisible currency. Hopefully this article will make it clear what a cryptocurrency is.*Let’s start simple: Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that, like all cryptocurrencies, runs on a technology called blockchain, a publicly available, decentralized ledger. Basically, this is a big database that records transactions. It’s maintained by everyone who uses the network, can’t be tampered with, and all transactions are recorded on it are public, for anyone to see.*Most people know about Bitcoin, but it’s just one of many coins on the market. On CoinMarketCap, which lists the coins currently trading, there are 2,400 coins. In part, that’s because it’s relatively easy to create a coin, and there aren’t many regulations. But take that figure with a pinch of salt: Only 900 coins currently trade more than $1 million a day.*You can trade cryptocurrencies on the market. Most trading is done on exchanges—safe bets are industry giants Binance or Coinbase. Signing up for an account is about as easy as joining PayPal. Most accept transfers of cryptocurrencies, but you’ll have to use a credit card or wire transfer if you want to buy with fiat currencies. After this, your website of choice might ask you to verify your identity—usually asking for a passport or driving licence, and then you’re turned loose onto the cryptocurrency exchange, to sink or swim at your own risk. Don’t let pundits confuse you: Pay attention to wider market trends and put your money in the larger, established networks if you want to stay safe.*Crypto*https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2020/04/10/901440-cryptocurrency.jpg*kubGCSj5y3k
